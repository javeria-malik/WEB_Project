        <p class="sectionTag text-big">The End oF Illietracy </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The ability to read and write is called literacy; its opposite is illiteracy.
             There are several degrees of literacy and many ways to define the benchmarks of who is literate and
              who is not.  
             according to international but admittedly inconsistent definitions of literacy, about eight out of ten male adults and seven out of ten female adults in the world were considered literate. In general, the populations with the highest levels of literacy were in the more economically advanced nations, including Japan, most European countries, Russia, Israel, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. Literacy rates in many of the more developed nations approached 100 percent. The poorer, developing nations, on the other hand, generally had the highest rates of illiteracy. Some 15 percent of the adults in Niger were literate (about 20 percent of the men and 7 percent of the women), for example, as were fewer than 25 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso and Somalia.
             Literacy rates can also vary greatly among different groups within countries, with the highest rates usually found among groups with the greatest socioeconomic status. There is also considerable gender disparity: about two thirds of the adults in the world who could not read and write were women. In many cultures the education of women has traditionally been either discouraged or considered a much lower priority than the education of men. Women, particularly in these cultures, are also on average much poorer than men. Countries with a large difference in male and female literacy rates included Yemen (with about 70 percent of the men literate but only 30 percent of the women), Nepal, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, 
             São Tomé and Príncipe, and Afghanistan.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Pakistan Literacy rate </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Pakistan has the second-lowest literacy rate in South Asia after Afghanistan, and in adult literacy it ranks 150th out of 188 countries worldwide. There are 
            also major gender disparities: the literacy rate for Pakistani males is 68%, compared to 45% for females.
            In Pakistan, the educational expenditure is served by 7% of the overall GDP. According to Human Development Report 2018, the country is ranking on the number of 150th out of 189 countries with a Human Development Indicator (HDI) value of 0.562. For the financial year of 2023, education-related expenditure increased by 5.7 percent. The figure after the calculation is Rs.699.2 billion in the financial year 2018 as compared to the figure of Rs. 663.4 billion for the financial year 2017. It is a federal figure but the contribution of provinces for annual development plans on education cannot ignore.  In the financial year of 2017-18, about 5.1 thousand higher secondary schools or inter colleges comprise 120.3 thousand teachers remain on the board.
             Higher secondary enrollment decreasing in the last two years.</p>
             <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Currently, Pakistan has the world’s second-highest number of out-of-school children (OOSC) with an estimated 22.8 million children aged 5-16 not attending school, representing 44 per cent of the total population in this age group.
                In the 5-9 age group, 5 million children are not enrolled in schools and after primary-school age, the number of OOSC doubles, with 11.4 million adolescents between the ages of 10-14 not receiving formal education. Disparities based on gender, socio-economic status, and geography are significant; in Sindh, 52 percent of the poorest children (58 percent girls) are out of school, and in Balochistan, 78 percent of girls are out of school.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Eductaion role in society </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">“Education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world!” Nelson Mandela said these
             impactful words in his Importance of Education in Society speech. Education is a stairway to the growth 
             and development of humankind. Education shapes society into a better world. It is essential to understand
              the importance of education in today’s society.education is a process of learning or acquiring knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. There are several steps involved in the entire process of obtaining and providing education. It includes teaching, training, discussion, research, storytelling, and similar other interactive activities. 
              Education can be both formal and informal through the method of teaching which is called pedagogy.
                </p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Gaps in service provision at all education levels is a major constraint to education access.  Socio-cultural demand-side barriers combined with economic factors and supply-related issues (such as availability of school facility), together hamper access and retention of certain marginalized groups, in particular adolescent girls. Putting in place a credible data system and monitoring measures to track retention and prevent drop-out of out-of-school children is still a challenge.

                    At systems level, inadequate financing, limited enforcement of policy commitments and challenges in equitable implementation impede reaching the most disadvantaged. An encouraging increase in education budgets has been observed though at 2.8 percent of the total GDP, it is still well short of the 4 percent target.</p>
